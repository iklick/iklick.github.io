## Abstract
It has recently been shown that the minimum energy solution of the control problem for a linear system produces a control trajectory that is nonlocal. An issue then arises when the dynamics represents a linearization of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of the system where the linearization is only valid in a local region of the state space. Here we provide a solution to the problem of optimally controlling a linearized system by deriving a time-varying set that represents all possible control trajectories parametrized by time and energy. As long as the control action terminus is defined within this set, the control trajectory is guaranteed to be local. If the desired terminus of the control action is far from the initial state, a series of local control actions can be performed in series, relinearizing the dynamics at each new position.<br/>
