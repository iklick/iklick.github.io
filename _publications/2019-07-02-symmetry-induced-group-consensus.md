excerpt: "The consensus problem is investigated for networked systems which exhibit <i>graph symmetries</i>. By using a block diagonalizing transformation that makes explicit symmetric and non-symmetric motion, we show that consensus is possible even when the entire system is unstable."

## Abstract
There has been substantial work studying consensus problems for which there is a single common final state, although there are many real-world complex networks for which the complete consensus may be undesirable. More recently, the concept of group consensus whereby subsets of nodes are chosen to reach a common final state distinct from others has been developed, but the methods tend to be independent of the underlying network topology. Here, an alternative type of group consensus is achieved for which nodes that are “symmetric” achieve a common final state. The dynamic behavior may be distinct between nodes that are not symmetric. We show how group consensus for heterogeneous linear agents can be achieved via a simple coupling protocol that exploits the topology of the network. We see that group consensus is possible on both stable and unstable trajectories. We observe and characterize the phenomenon of “isolated group consensus,” where one or more clusters may achieve group consensus while the other clusters do not.<br/>
