excerpt: "We hypothesized that the large control energy that arises when applying the minimum energy control to a complex network is due to the implicit requirement of <i>perfect accuracy</i>. By relaxing this requirement, we show there is an exponential reduction in control energy."

## Abstract
Recently, it has been shown that the control energy required to control a large dynamical complex network is prohibitively large when there are only a few control inputs. Most methods to reduce the control energy have focused on where, in the network, to place additional control inputs. We also have seen that by controlling the states of a subset of the nodes of a network, rather than the state of every node, the required energy to control a portion of the network can be reduced substantially. The energy requirements exponentially decay with the number of target nodes, suggesting that large networks can be controlled by a relatively small number of inputs as long as the target set is appropriately sized. Here, we see that the control energy can be reduced even more if the prescribed final states are not satisfied strictly. We introduce a new control strategy called balanced control for which we set our objective function as a convex combination of two competitive terms: (i) the distance between the output final states at a given final time and given prescribed states and (ii) the total control energy expenditure over the given time period. We also see that the required energy for the optimal balanced control problem approximates the required energy for the optimal target control problem when the coefficient of the second term is very small. We validate our conclusions in model and real networks regardless of system size, energy restrictions, state restrictions, input node choices, and target node choices.
