## Abstract
Symmetry in graphs which describe the underlying topology of networked dynamical systems plays an essential role in the emergence of clusters of synchrony. Many real networked systems have a very large number of symmetries. Often one wants to test new results on large sets of random graphs that are representative of the real networks of interest. Unfortunately, existing graph generating algorithms will seldom produce graphs with any symmetry and much less ones with desired symmetry patterns. Here, we present an algorithm that is able to generate graphs with any desired symmetry pattern. The algorithm can be coupled with other graph generating algorithms to tune the final graphâ€™s properties of interest such as the degree distribution.
