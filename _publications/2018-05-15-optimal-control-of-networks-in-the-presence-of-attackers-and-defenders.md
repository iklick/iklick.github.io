## Abstract
We consider the problem of a dynamical network whose dynamics is subject to external perturbations (“attacks”) locally applied at a subset of the network nodes. We assume that the network has an ability to defend itself against attacks with appropriate countermeasures, which we model as actuators located at (another) subset of the network nodes. We derive the optimal defense strategy as an optimal control problem. We see that the network topology as well as the distribution of attackers and defenders over the network affect the optimal control solution and the minimum control energy. We study the optimal control defense strategy for several network topologies, including chain networks, star networks, ring networks, and scale free networks.
